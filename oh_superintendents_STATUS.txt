OHIO SUPERINTENDENT DIRECTORY - EXTRACTION ATTEMPT
Date: 2026-02-01
Status: INCOMPLETE - DATA NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE
Time Spent: 15 minutes

SUMMARY:
Ohio does not maintain a publicly accessible centralized superintendent directory online.
Multiple official sources returned 404 errors or contained no contact information.

SOURCES CHECKED:
✗ Ohio Department of Education - Superintendent pages (404)
✗ BASA (Buckeye Association of School Administrators) - Site unreachable
✗ Ohio School Boards Association - Member directory (404)
✗ Management Council of Ohio - District directory (404)
✗ Ohio DOE downloadable data files - Return HTML error pages
✗ Ohio Report Cards site - JavaScript-heavy, no direct data access
✓ NCES CCD Database - Has district names/phones but NO superintendent info

DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED:
Total: 1,061 public school districts in Ohio
Data available: District name, address, phone, enrollment
Data NOT available: Superintendent name, email, direct contact

NEXT STEPS (MANUAL REQUIRED):
1. Request official data from Ohio DOE via public records request
2. Use browser automation to scrape individual district websites
3. Purchase data from commercial education database service
4. Build dataset manually from top 100 districts

OUTPUT:
No CSV created - insufficient data to extract
