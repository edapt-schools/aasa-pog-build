Illinois Superintendent Directory Search - Findings Report
================================================================

TASK: Find and extract Illinois superintendent directory data
TIME BUDGET: 15 minutes
TIME USED: ~12 minutes

FINDINGS:
---------

1. **IASA (Illinois Association of School Administrators)**
   - URL: https://www.iasaedu.org
   - Has a "Membership Directory" but it's BEHIND A LOGIN WALL
   - Not publicly accessible without credentials

2. **ISBE (Illinois State Board of Education)**
   - URL: https://www.isbe.net
   - Has an "Entity Profile System (EPS)" that serves as directory
   - Documentation states: "All EPS information is compiled into an Excel workbook that is updated nightly and available publicly"
   - HOWEVER: Could not locate the actual public Excel file download link
   - Checked multiple paths - all returned 404 errors

3. **Illinois Report Card**
   - URL: https://www.illinoisreportcard.com
   - Contains school/district data but not superintendent contact info
   - Focused on academic performance data

4. **ISBE Data Library**
   - Contains historical report card data files
   - Does NOT contain contact/personnel directories
   - Academic and statistical data only

OBSTACLES:
----------
- No Brave Search API key configured (couldn't use web_search)
- IASA directory requires member login
- EPS public Excel export location unknown/undocumented in public pages
- No direct CSV/Excel download links found for superintendent contacts

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Contact ISBE directly to request the public EPS Excel extract
2. Try accessing IWAS/EPS system with proper credentials
3. Check data.illinois.gov open data portal (briefly checked, needs deeper search)
4. May need to scrape individual district websites or use paid directory services

DELIVERABLE STATUS:
-------------------
❌ No CSV file created - unable to locate publicly accessible superintendent directory
